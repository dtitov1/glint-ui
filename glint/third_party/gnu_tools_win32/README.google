This directory contains tools from the "GNU utilities for Win32" project
(http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/), which provides ports of common GNU
utilities to native Win32.

The UnxUtils.zip file that can be downloaded from the site 
(http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/UnxUtils.zip) includes
pre-compiled binaries in usr/local/wbin subdirectory.

The 'files' folder here contains only a few executables from this 
set - enough to build Glint on Win32. On Mac and Linux GNU make
utility is part of OS.
