This directory contains tools from the "GNU utilities for Win32" project
(http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/), which provides "ports of common GNU
utilities to native Win32".

The UnxUtils.zip file that can be downloaded from the site includes
pre-compiled binaries in usr/local/wbin subdirectory.
I took a very few utilities from there (make, cp, rm, mkdir, uname) that are
needed to build on Win32 and checked them into 'files' directory.
